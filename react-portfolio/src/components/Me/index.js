            <p>As I started my journey to becoming a web developer, I realised very quickly that abosorbing everything there is to know about web development was simply not going to happen. This industry is changing so rapidly! The way customers interact with websites, the way Companies and Media get their message and marketing on the wide web, all are so different now to when I first dabbled with web development in my teens.</p>
            <p>My curiosity started in my Step-Fathers printing factory. My Step-Father had a team of graphic designers who would create the most beautiful marketing material on their huge Mac screens. It looked so glamorous and all those glossy colours... Wow! I promptly enrolled in graphic design as one of the final units for my HSC. From there I was sold. Lost in all the possibilities. That lasted a year, then school finished, I decided to have my children young, then somehow ended up with a job in finance. Home Lending to be exact. Here I recieved rigorous sales and compliance training, learning all the ins and outs to the banking industry. All the while being curious about the systems and the applications and software that was being used by both the banks and the customers. Fast forward 4 years and I am now returning to my passion once again.</p>
            <p>Completing the Full Stack BootCamp course with Sydney Uni was one of the best decisions I ever made. I can now apply my passion for web design, and my extensive knowledge of the finance industry, to develop interactive web applications for Finance Companies and Banks. My focus on the customer element first and foremost. Ensuring the customer has a smooth and enjoyable experience on my application is of utmost importance. In finance, and any sales enviroment, you need the user interface to be engaging and interactive to keep the customer on your site as long as possible. The longer the customer spends on one site, the higher the intent to act becomes. We are all time poor in this busy world of husstle and busstle. One bad move on an application can see your customer and potential business lost to the next best site on Google Search. My applications will enable customers to enjoy spending time managing their affairs without the complications of a poorly designed website, resulting in happier customers and happier companies. </p>
